20348,1,attention spoilers first let say rob roy one best films amazing achievement involved especially acting liam neeson jessica lange john hurt brian cox tim roth michael canton jones painted wonderful portrait honor dishonor men represent alas constantly unfairly gets compared braveheart two entirely different films probably similar fact scots historical scotland yet comparison frequently bothers seems almost assumed braveheart better film rob roy like braveheart lot idea comparing rob roy little insulting put quite simply love braveheart pale shadow much love rob roy particular reasons rob roy real people let face william wallace braveheart real person legend martyr larger life figurehead depiction also perfect person never wrong basically showing scot countrymen promised land finally fail fault like jesus betrayed people trusted even goes worst kind torture wants freedom much depiction wallace well done effective really inspire intrigue find human ambiguity far facinating human perfection last temptation christ better film king kings also one reasons think rob roy better braveheart rob roy may heroic brave far perfect makes several mistakes affected lives many loved ones sure bearing false claim duke argyll act nobility courage also act egoism self centeredness let us forget kinfolk claimed protect driven homeless end film act rob best could could ask rob wife mary also normal ambigious person let us start though looks film sure beautiful wear makeup basically allows natural beauty show compare two loves one depending point view william wallace braveheart two ladies hot hardly indicitive women looked time especially lay persons maybe fair comparison another example rob roy attempts accuracy far effective throughout rob roy mary live vicious rape dastardly carrion cunningham feels compelled tell rob struggle knows rob must seek revenge rape revenge would surely mean death rob mary prepared sacrifice villains rob roy equally compelling although enemies braveheart well written hardly original robert bruce man brave cowardly plagued moral decisions familar fictional realm take claim king scotland betray wallace order ensure safety family name bruce ambigious character braveheart brutus julius ceasar fredo godfather part ii types characters hardly original longshanks although compelling villain right one dimensional epidemy evil tyrant ways stand direct contrast wallace heroism rob roy three villains wonderful chicanery first let start marquis montrose man obsessed self image willing let innocent man suffer see mocked favorite words factor man obsessed power upset man great noble bearing duke argyll considered greater providency shamefully self obsessed insecure evil aristocrat ways make unique cunningham callarn conspirators rob roy also roy direct assailants callarn cunning cowardace almost comical anything maintain good marquis includes backstabbing trickery cunningham compelling character seems raised whatever obtain status affection marquis needs father little know marquis real father therefore opportunity obtain wealth comes callarn grabs without even questioning much like evil modern man self centered vain cares consequences actions others many criticized tim roth performance film overacting hogwash say clear cunningham simply evil also psychopath throughout film world man stepson go around shooting random people amusement cunningham much unbelievable character live society people seem decreased value human life rob roy simply teaches us circumstances decreased value changed problem throughout human history vanity human heart allow capacity compassion rob roy mary give us hope goodness prevail snakes always exist world another character find fascinating duke argyll true nobleman values honesty courtesy direct contrast marquis appreciates bravery rob roy mary direct vexation marquis factor gives world hope people power hopefully people like marquis exception rule final duel rob roy exciting battle scenes braveheart one thing get tired people telling braveheart better film battle scenes first battle scenes hardly original spartacus gladiator hollywood long tradition historical european battle scenes braveheart best battle scenes ever put film suffer one important problem battle scenes context except fight freedom get wrong duels hardly original either fact probably times many films duels battle scenes context duel cunningham rob roy beauty behold one greatest scenes film history let explain first fighting style bearing two characters duel describe characters perfectly cunningham effette dangerous rob roy strong courageous cunningham uses fencing sword rob uses broadsword cunningham fights quick tricky movements roy fighting style obvious whole film deliberately slow first half exciting second half leading moment powerful stuff clear rob must exterminate menacing evil plagued whole world rob finally gets upper hand literally figuratively one greatest moments film history rob wins live honor powerful cunningham use music absolutely chilling scene good prevailing real evil powerful seeing dude get disemboweled yell freedom hey maybe rob roy realistic braveheart know people aristocracy scotsmen talked like people rob roy feel clearly attempt capture speech patterns feel many people bored rob roy simply understand characters saying case read shakesphere put close captioning rob roy actually one greatest written films many dialogue film clever maybe watch film couple times understand contrast dialogue braveheart hardly interesting course expect main character scotsman played australian legend clearly attempt capture speech times film takes place several centuries rob roy yet talk like people today thus reason many people like better audiences today become increasingly lazy want take time patience understand things complex therefore many epic films expect see villians speak recognizable english accent heroes speak vernacular far away american language sure clear wallace scotish sounding like scotty star trek couple aye acknowledgement scots film fit hollywood tradition believe scots sound descriptions prove rob roy better film braveheart hardly proves one thing shows hardly common knowledge braveheart better film rob roy put simply rob roy film themes apropos today world braveheart film legend inspiring hardly realistic make decision think better grade score
